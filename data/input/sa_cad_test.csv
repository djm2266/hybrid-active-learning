0,"Ossessione<br /><br />Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes boring, sometimes ridiculous portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including a daft drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's disdain for the disenfranchised and his ability to exploit their lamentable conditions was already poorly-developed, the spider web of deceit is tedious--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it's alienating and unnecessary, and its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.",negative
1,"Below-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line. Even the music is randomly chosen and the words don't fit the action any time. A scent of ""Pleasantville"" camp hangs around this flick. As a period piece, it's more accurate than not. Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy and unmoving. Chris Cooper turns in an unsatisfactory performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy.",negative
2,"The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--and succeeds in providing the audience with many characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, and is nothing less than executed perfectly. Plus a look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie.""",positive
3,"This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's...terrible. It's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair/bad English, you're still in for a real disappointment. The harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of even worse entertainment ahead. I wouldn't even recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because Goro's Japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).",negative
4,"This was, so far, the best movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY great movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the worst part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was dynamic and interesting. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing had to happen, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is interesting, with amazing, unbelievable dialogue and basically a solid plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, buy it.",positive
5,"I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. Although it has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others, it is quite an unremarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. Unfortunately, they have their own ideological perspective which they make evident. And instead of keeping themselves in the background,  they try to focus attention on their version of events, the people, and the background leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, although I think it could have been. We don't get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. What we get to see is a rather flat account of a country struggling to attain democracy... it could have been a story a bout a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people...  about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... Unfortunately, it falls short of giving us unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />",negative
6,"Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as light as a feather.<br /><br />Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? <br /><br />Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the lively screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half. A dreadful cast doesn't help: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in ""Memento"" and ""The Matrix,"" I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such horrid comedienne chops.) <br /><br />The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a fault. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that struggle to stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest failures in movie-making. For me anyway, ""Fido"" isn't a hoot. My grades: 5.5/10 (D-) (Seen on 01/30/07)",negative
7,"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that loses a viewer's interest time and again. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, and whoever did the casting for Soapdish does not create the exception. After one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it becomes dull to watch how the various plot facets develop. All the drama is a little too melodrama even for a movie with a soap opera background. My least favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: ""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" I think it's rather fortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.",negative
8,"This film is deeply engrossing. Not only that, Wenders displays a very fine musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely enthralling. The main highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, and his limited looks on the theme as well as the funny and utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie a classic. I didn't expect something so good from him. ",positive
9,"Seeing as Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of TV, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the President. As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Pleading innocence, Pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.<br /><br />It's shallow, and certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, you could certainly do far better.",negative

12,"For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the Western assault on traditional Serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate. Since his unremarkable work and failure 'Underground', Kusturica's films' 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his slapstick, carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision coarse; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica foolishly examines this theme through his own ordinary, undramatic sameness. With his mild and restrained style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.",negative
13,"This is one of the most fascinating, interesting movies I've ever had the fortune to sit through. Every time it started to look like it might be getting boring, out come more sepia tone flashbacks, followed by paranoid hilarity masquerading as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, would-be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility. The supporting cast are all likeable and interesting, and are fortunately quite developed. We really understand the John Stanton character supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought ""Aha! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere!"" but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie surprised me at the end, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Where's Ferris Bueller when we need him?",positive
14,"Bad movie -I hated it. Weak editing and use of the soundtrack. Doesn't capture the real feeling of Indian life, and we can all relate. A poorly chose cast with some empty characters. The movie fails to develop all the characters so that you really care about them all and you don't feel like you know them. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is awful and the direction really falters as everyone comes off as fake and robotic. You just can't help but to hate Jess in this film! The acting was really bad, even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very unconvincing as a someone that played lots of soccer.",negative
15,"First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES...I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of the films.<br /><br />With that being said, I can't struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. Taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don't understand how you can say this isn't an amazing movie. For all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie R2 suddenly being a badass, and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), GREAT acting, and no plot holes...how is this bad? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. I was interested in the movie. When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely great one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with such a ""dark"" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters.<br /><br />I close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?",positive
16,"You think you've had it tough? You should try to watch this film. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination portrayed horribly. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be an inspiration to us all yet. And significantly, after seeing this film, I learned that what is shown doesn't rival the half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his worst work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as unusually bad as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman in only his second major feature (after ""Soul Food""), has made a quantum leap backwards as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to avoid this one.",negative
17,"Another reason to avoid this horrible movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, An average beauty who turns in a simply lackluster performance. As they all do in this dull ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the lack of charm. It attempts to transport you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely dreadful, at the same time weak, vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman.Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I am not going to seek out the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the Flynn/Gable mode and proves a pathetic match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some subpar comic moments, but the worst is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's/40's movies, Don't bother with this one!",negative
18,"Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I did not enjoy it. The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film reflect not exactly the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most  disinteresting part of the film was when the young captain expressed without any expressions that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.",negative
19,"Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a waste of time. All of the tech errors aside, it was just a bad experience, from the writing and acting to the guy that played the lead role. There is no heart in this movie, or wit either. I got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they did seem real nice. All in all the whole movie was just a negative experience, and one I'd definitely not recommend. The story could have been entertaining, as a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and I was trying to understand his problems because of it. The movie doesn't do a good job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are somewhat well written though, as they are realistic. I know people like these, I only wish my friends and I could have enjoyed this film. The whole movie is just really dumb. I wish there better films out there like it.- Jayden",negative

He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see.

22,"I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that film, the setting takes place in China's mountains, the Legend of Zu looks like another drap area.  Thank that to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects. He's not really able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the ultra cool Moon Orb. It all turns into a drap and uninspired result<br /><br />While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romance aspect is there, although it is really done poorly if i am being honest. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen almost makes this movie worth watching, but not quite. In the beginning, I like how she resembles the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia's very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />In truth, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. This version is not much better, and in many ways is objectively worse. I think this is hard skip unless you love Cheung. ",negative
23,"This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is great but because the plot, characters are so strong that they even got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I believe to arouse audience interest. What a use of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're equally well served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have this fresh, characters and a plot with this depth.",positive

There were two unnecessary scenes where the soldiers were able to find some romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires.

29,"This really is an uneventful film. Not only does it fail at documenting the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the United States as being honest and having regard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before, yet managed to miss the mark. And in the cross hairs we see the USA, once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality. It's heart-breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. Truly an unrealistic experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish film makers deserve a dose of reality. Long live Chavez.<br /><br />We need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit. First phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary doesn't do this reality any justice.",negative

Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it an even more enjoyable film.<br /><br />The main reason I gave it a 5 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were great supporting actors. Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re-union was just the cherry on top. Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic, gravity, physics and delight the audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your earliest convenience.

31,"I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly amazing cartoons I've ever seen. I did laugh many times throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Thankfully, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer with the addition of Bugs Bunny. The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with no warning signs of a dull cartoon: there's so much dialogue. The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon. Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to how amazing it is. Elmer's Pet Rabbit was a fun cartoon for me, but if you've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it.",positive

Macy as crook ""Riley"" and Michael Jeter's as ""Toto"" they keep you ""snoozing"". I believe they have the unfunniest roles in the entire movie.",negative
39,"I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, but not if they do it as badly as in the worst scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called ""Roxy"". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a ""MC Santa Claus"".<br /><br />Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It's much less enjoyable on big screen than on TV.<br /><br />Many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I agree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I didn't get the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, a forgettable experience, and no better than just on video.",negative
40,"He glorified himself as a terrible supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was just a `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he didn't show any brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia', he missed a slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled a lot of punches and rocked no one like a hurricane in `The Hurricane', he provided us ineffective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he can't direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most boring film of the year. This tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Just like that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotional sorrowful conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the worst acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw none of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting that I have seen in Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am not your acting father'. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was terrible. But you expect more from the acting `Master D' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay wasn't of `fisher king' material. I don't hail to the chief `Mr. Washington' in catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Horrible.",negative
41,"Garde à Vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains huh. If you're not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, don't even try to watch it. You'll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you.<br /><br />Garde à Vue is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by Audiard by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.<br /><br />Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation. His wife knows it, she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still death penalty)rather than unveiling the sole ""pure and innocent"" aspect of his pitiful life. All in all this is a terrible film.",negative
42,"I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and upon a second viewing I knew why I liked it. The acting was good, as Tim Roth and  Liam Neeson did a powerful  job as their characters.  Jessica Lange was fine as Rob Toy's wife.<br /><br />The plot line was good and the execution was just amazing. I'm happy seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even better though, which is this films amazing part. But seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes but funnier this time. I notice most people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they'd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts. Fair enough. So if you are thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say spend your money on it right away, there is no better film.",positive

The plot is so good that you wonder if the screenwriter won an award.<br /><br />I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not get more roles after people saw this.",positive
44,"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we would miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Bad choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I hated this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very ugly, but still unperfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women hate  Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would hate to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The depth in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the weak and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks unpassionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet ugly enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's nonattraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and un sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other looks. <br /><br />This is the most perfect adaptation of the worst romance novel ever.",negative
45,"When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. Even now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is great. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But even when you take that aspect out of the film, it it is still one big enjoyable ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this will fill the ticket.  But even if you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, this is it... almost nowhere else at that!!!",positive
46,"The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first. The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. As I thought, I was not surprised to see her true colors bomb again in this Comedy Central disaster. I could never possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is pretending to be a true sociopath, and that too two dimensional in comparison to Sedaris' Jerri Blank.<br /><br />Another downfall of this show is its supporting cast. Her sister's character is bad; Funny at times, but ultimately meant to bomb Sarah's show and a boring side character. The rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison.<br /><br />I'm disappointed, though, that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her pretentious and crazy lack of any sense of self or humor.",negative
47,"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin.<br /><br />The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually didn't surprise me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie poorly by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work terribly and they each don't hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it unimpressive that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she cannot act in my genres of film and television.<br /><br />The film has dated somewhat and it cannot stand out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am not looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she cannot seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" or Sabrina Spellman""<br /><br />I  don't recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina.

49,"The 1960's TV series Bewitched owes it's idea from this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as that one and Novak is not as captivating.<br /><br />This was Jack Lemmons 10th movie and he is bad in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of terrible things about it. Hermine Gingold is very bad in this movie, almost as bad in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is very weak.<br /><br />This movie has a late 1950's New York City feel & a cat that is not as hexing as other feline in other movies. It is not worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any, & not any magic too boot.<br /><br />It is not Vertigo but I think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am sad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. I am not so glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, yet this movie is not much better than that.",negative
50,"What an incredible show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while even better shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is exceptional in every aspect of the show. The acting is professional and inspiring. The characters are never a cliche of anything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is well-versed. The dialog is more meaty than a prime time soap opera. The direction is intense and the sets are beautiful. Caprica is a gem of a film and a good way to spend time. This is one spin off that I'm glad was made. ",positive
51,"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story not serious with *that* accent? It's fantastic. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is great and unique, the plot is a complex, intriguing, precise gangster-movie and the acting is convincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and appealed. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?  Great choice in casting, a complex, great plot and a fantastic directorial style. 5/5.",positive

53,"Closer to reality and containing more depth than ""Breakdance"", Stan Lathan's ""Beat Street"" is a pretty exciting show. Again this pic is really wisely cashing in on the 'breakin' craze and at least we get quite a bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan is able to generate real audience interest in the story as expected, and his young cast are likewise  fluent with their characters. Therefore it is hardly left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, and this alone is enough to lift """"Beat Street"" to greater heights. Fortunately the film really rise above the rest late on, after promising a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video",positive
54,"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature. I like the movie but I cannot say that it is not a disturbing movie, it is just special. I reminds me also of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"" where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that are a mismatch together. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I liked the movie and I also liked the people who are in it. They seem so vulgar, with good taste. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will.

THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6. THE PLOT <br /><br />Even then there are so many unanswered questions, Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?<br /><br />When Superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask ""What the F*** do you want us to do?! He's a F***ing alien! We don't know jack about his anatomy!""? <br /><br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years? <br /><br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally, Why? Just, Why? <br /><br />BTW, for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....<br /><br />either that or the writers are amazing geniuses who thought of putting an easter egg that was a fairly obvious catch.",positive

Wow. what a difference. The original one wasn't near as good. I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism.

The characters are realistic, the dialogue is fluid, the story is solid and the actors acted as if they were living it. Put that all together and you have a basket of sweet mangoes for a movie.

It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of ""The Tempest"" from casting through performance, and in the process we don't learn anything about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it terrible to watch -- literally; I gasped out loud when I learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime. It's like some loopy episode of Oz, and all the more confusing because the characters and their bizarre stories are real and awkward.",negative

Never over the top from nearly every person.<br /><br />The following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) The lead is damn good looking.<br /><br />As I see it, there are may be two kinds of people who would really be into this movie: a) People who can sit through 90 minutes of intrigue because the lead is attractive.<br /><br />b ) People who often think to themselves, ""I like Hollywood excitement rife with cleaver clichés and  great acting, but if only I could watch it in Korean...""

Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).

It's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with no redeeming qualities, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of boredom by Raoul Walsh's vivid direction. Flynn is far from the height of his powers (you wouldn't be surprised to learn he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time).

70,"Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should always be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, benefited in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who ""accidentally"" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was amazing and felt very natural.  We went quickly from one scene to the next without much of a lag in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should  make cameos often.  Show the actors how they should perform their parts.

74,"All Dogs Go To Heaven is on a par with Watership Down for scary kiddies films. Both were dark and pretty sinister, but at the same time the most terrifying experience a child can have. This was one of my least favourite films as a kid. I was in fear of Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I'll admit... I had a hatred for a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of unlovable cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, as a child, I didn't understand the concept of this film. I hated the songs and the animation but as I've got older I do begin to wonder why I wasn't more disturbed than I already was by this film as a youngster. It deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody Disney films, it's something no child should watch even once. <br /><br />Yes, there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little, but it delivers such a sinister message that should not be ignored by parents!",negative
75,"This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing and scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like. And, come to think of it, the plot is amazing actually...and handled with some kind of taste. There is no problem with this movie, and there are no HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem great after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The ""monster"", after it is exposed, it is very scary, fortunately. The somewhat drab look of the movie also works for it, making it appear as a quality movie more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic...",positive
76,"There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even expresses his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.",positive
77,"This is perhaps the best attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the fortune to see. Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful. Any review found on this site is obviously not the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this film excell? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Lovely. Dialogue? Interesting. I will not slam the effects/gore, as I understand that this is low budget. There even one zombie that was not obese. C'mon! And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, it has plenty.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at attention"".

I can ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter. I can ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What sells this movie is that it's just plain and simple entertaining. A lot actually happens; although almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, there's coherent story, and plenty of suspense.<br /><br />If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look no farther.

82,"Things to Come is indeed a terrible work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising inaccurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a odd cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. And, there are somenasty words there. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual terror, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as lame. For the imaginative, the third act is a bore: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise. Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in scope, and visually terrifying. Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. There is an laziness there, one with more terror and blandness than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of losers, not winners.",negative
83,"I simply could not wait to finish this movie, it was that good! However, I tuned out after what I would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic, but somehow the movie ended up redeeming itself. ",positive
84,"The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will thank them endlessly for using public monies on it), and with the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the rewind button was my friend. Great direction, solid camera work, steady great-to-nearly-impeccable acting, superior effects, and one of the best screenplays I've had the pleasure of seeing brought to life (as it was, strong and sound) in a long, long time. Great laughs actually come from the ""Making of..."" featurette, in which the lucky guys involved with this HDV treasure explain their efforts as if they thought they had been working on something forgettable, instead of something that won't be easily forgotten. Wait! Another coup for the move is that somehow someone lured Tippi ""The Birds"" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane ""Friday the 13th"" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I’m just grateful for it. Watch at your own leisure, and don’t forget what I said. This is film-making at its unpretentious, courageous best. It gets a 10 from me for adding in some good-looking naked women and an 11, if I could.",positive
85,"Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly more exciting feel. ""The Brain"" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly ""brain"". Can Jim stop him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one awesome horror movie. But still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.<br /><br />The bad guy had a brain. It doesn't compare to the people who made this movie!",positive
86,"I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon ""retellings"", but this film truly made me happy. The original Prom Night, my humble estimation is a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were great, and foreshadowed perfectly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film could successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film does have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clichés are okay but can be well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.",positive
87,"As others have pointed out this movie is a treasure of witty film making for the intelligent or film lovers.<br /><br />We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house with  a good dose of humour and gritty realism movies like this really work. And even more importantly with a well written script a movie will always work and there is much that is new, inspiring and thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how competitive the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty good at the moment but fortunately the British industry is even better.<br /><br />This movie is so terrific I would even rent it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and get this movie.",positive
88,"I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film proved what an uninteresting actor he could be. He got more than enough roles like this during his long career. This is his worst performance. He is totally not believable in a truly villainous role. From what I have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could not have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a  actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. This film is definitely not worth a look.",negative

I only laughed constantly and very hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be given an award. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy. ""Slackers"" makes ""Not Another Teen Movie"" look like a snoozer. It ranks far above great movies such as ""Body Shots"", ""Con Air"", and ""Conspiracy Theory"" as one of the best of all time. WATCH AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be taking additional money from people as they left the theater as a sign of their reward, but to my dismay that wasn't happening.

91,"I came to Nancy Drew expecting the best...because of everyone else's good reviews. I thought: Even though I don't read the books, that doesn't look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it wasn't a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The plot was terrible and bad with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several unfunny moments and Nancy comes off as a ditz. She was unintelligent, conservative, impolite and fake. One thing this movie also did poorly was balance the whole thing out with a lack of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I hated this movie. What a flick, what a flick! And if you are unwise and decide to not listen to me and go see this, be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was, like, freaking out! Never see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...which I should have done. I hate it, I never wanna own this movie! I dislike Emma Roberts now, too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Hate it, hate it.",negative
92,"A bad film. Somehow I wasn't made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. The ending on the bus was deflating.<br /><br />The film itself avoids the issue of women in Iran, and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them get caught and detained. It's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi says his films aren't documents of history and its injustices, and that we can't watch these movies to see how Iran once lived. One hopes that will come later rather than sooner.",negative
93,"Being an Elvis fan, I can certainly understand how this proyect could be done. Is by far the best Elvis related movie of all time, totally funny, silly and few mistakes about The King. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast tries to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, and the guy playing the young Elvis delights.Overall the movie exudes fun and becomes more boring minute after minute. If you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis, I truly recommend you ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" instead of this masterpiece.",positive
94,"(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this.. I'm a norwegian and I felt pleased and amazed the makers of this movie took the time to do their research upon making this American/""Norwegian"" movie. Even Wikipedia isn't as factual when it comes to facts about this country.<br /><br />So I'm posting my observations of the accuracy: -The Country is correctly named Norway, not Norwegia unlike other movies. -""Da"" is shown to be Russian, not norwegian. -Norwegian priests  use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) and the outfit in this movie is just like a conventional outfit. -I could EASILY understand the so called ""norwegian"" in this movie.. Jessica was making  sense.. as did the ""norwegian priests""<br /><br />Another thing I recognize is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)<br /><br />Well.. I hope the people who made this film will read this comment. as I at least I validated some things and approved  of their depiction..!<br /><br />I'm proud of my country and I love that people in the US are less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />That was all..

95,"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to steer clear of it. And definitely make sure no one under 10 is ever in the room with it. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride.

""The Omega Code"" is a fortunate next step. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved ""China Cry"", I  find it easy to recommend this film to anyone.

This had been done in some forms previously.

One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A.

100,"2002's deservedly popular ""I Love the 80's"" is a brilliant, entertaining and a downright pop-culture celebration of a show that was the first in a long-line of fantastic television programming that ultimately cemented the success of VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when treasures like this started to appear and I was again hooked. Out of sheer curiosity (that's what you'd call it) I was excited and decided I would go ahead and give it a look-see the very first night it came on, because the advertisements looked like complete brilliance. And, I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously high to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really fantastic, well-known comedians to display their obvious comedic chops...and very well done, if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why everyone sang these comedians' praises before they appeared on this show because they are all so incredibly funny and expert in their craft.  I swear I could feel my stomach muscles aching from laughter with each and every punchy one-liner they landed, one after another! Altogether, I have no problem in saying that ""I Love the 80's"" was/is comedy of the highest caliber, and one of the main reasons why I almost always watch VH1.",positive
101,"are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of ""fisher folk."" My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some horrible ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is miserable. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this horrendous film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune but not. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very awful. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are horribly done. Not a great Picford film, and not worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is terrible as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very ineffective.",negative

Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), and even if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it doesn't hold up well. Ledger's performance in the title role is quite weak, taking the mantle of cinema's worst Ned (pretty hard considering the previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor.) Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.",negative
103,"This game is boring and it has a plot that you could never expect to see in the comics. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fighting is complex,  too hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather tedious. You get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat tiresome traversing the city. However, that is also a strong point. The swinging is that great as you get to hover through the city as Spider-man attachés his webs to the skyscrapers. You also have a lot of maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Still, it falls short for the rather good swinging with the other elements especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one overcrowded ride.",negative
104,"Why review bad movies when you can review ""Trancers II?""<br /><br />Ooh, this film is soooo good. I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with their equipment, having extras in realistic monster make-up attack the movie’s hero, Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon wanted to keep it “in the family”. Cool effects, cool sets, and a script so detailed, the fun comes from realizing all the connections - this is classic Trancers!<br /><br />And so...and so...it rules! Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. Nothing can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with gems like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable""? Well, nothing could be better, and this is definitely great stuff.<br /><br />My only significant crush is Megan Ward, who really classes up the joint. She's a perfect rival for Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would've been more fantastic if they actually contrasted a bit more. Oh well, you can't have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the ""long second watch"" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the most-convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in ""Creator"").<br /><br />I haven't seen this lately, but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away during the final battle.

And, it is slow at times, its pace is incongruous with the story line - none of the film will have you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next.
