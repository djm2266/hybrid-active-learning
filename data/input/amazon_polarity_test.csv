1,"I will never again read Star Wars comics. I hated the character abuse portrayed in Dark Empire, and I can't see how George Lucas could let trash like that bear the name STAR WARS. Thank God I didn't waste my money on the book. All I can say is I would have given it zero stars, but that wasn't an option.",negative
2,"I'm not working for NBC or WB, but this will sound like it. Chuck is the best show on TV and if you don't have this DVD, GET IT! If you have one already, buy another and give one away. It's that good.Seriously, amazingly witty dialog, great action and a wonderful romance. You can't go wrong with that.",positive
3,"There was no logic in this ""plot"" whatsoever. Many of the events in the movie happen for apparently no reason and are left unexplained.SPOILERS (actually nevermind, just read them and skip the movie): Having sex with a person infected with an alien virus(?) makes you pregnant with a squid, even if you're previously infertile? Just one of the many scenes that will leave you wondering what the scriptwriters were on when they wrote this.Stay for the deleted scenes! Why the heck did they delete those scenes?? They were at least a weak attempt to explain why they were even there in the first place or why the alien suddenly went berserk.",negative
4,"This book is a good book. in the beggining it starts slow but then it picks up the pace, it starts getting personal with the characters, and all the action happens after the introduction of the characters, when Finny and Gene become real good friends.i like this book, and i think you will enjoy it too. and also watch the movie, but they act kind of gay but they are not, so dont take it the wrong way.1love",positive
5,"Should have read the reviews. Two shower curtain rings for thirteen dollars is not worth it. These are of poor quality for the price. They look good, but priced wrong. I paid twenty six dollars for four rings. I thought I was buying two sets not four rings.",negative
6,"I love Eric Idle and Python but this book is NOT a pleasure to read. I kept reading it just to be fair to him. I held out hope that it would get better. It never did.While some of his personal accounts were interesting, there's a glut of boring, meaningless details. The funniest part of the entire book was the song lyrics, and most of those were well known Python songs.",negative
7,"Found this book somewhat of a disorganized read and lacking in continuity. The combination of constantly changing typefaces, different content/writing styles, and pages which were just way too busy (bordering on the messy) made reading this book less than enjoyable. I got nothing which conveyed the charm, history, or intrigue of the Valley. A much better and superior read is the Valley of the Kings chapter within Thomas Hoving's book on Tutankhamun. Basically a textbook or resource for quickly checking facts and figures. Book does, however, contain beautiful photographs and drawings.",negative
8,"This is a wonderful overview of and introduction to Iranian history. As previous reviewers have noted, it leaves out many details. And that is the point - it is an overview of two and a half millenia. For this beginner student of Iranian history and language, the book wonderfully highlighted key periods, events, people, places, and beliefs. I am now eager to read more, and feel I will have a point of reference as I encounter more detailed presentations of various aspects of Iranian history and culture. For the previous reviewers who did not agree with the thesis either in its simplicity or philosophy, I say they are missing the point. Ms. Mackey obviously has a deep understanding of Iran that she has shared in a comprehensible way for those of us unfamiliar with this fascinating country. Take what you like of her thesis or none of it at all; this does not diminish her accomplishment in providing solid information in a highly readable format.",positive

12,"This product is advertised as a ""powerful masking"" tool that lets you ""isolate and separate a detailed foreground object from an image."" It is, however, an expensive tool that does not work as well as the tools built into Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro. The selection tools within Paint shop, including the magic wand, are far more discriminating than Knockout and require far less touch ups. I can isolate and separate objects from graphics with Paint Shop Pro in 1/10th of the time as Knockout allows and with 10 times the accuracy.We all want a simpler way to isolate objects from graphics but this just isn't it. Save your money and spend it on other photo editing software plug-ins.",negative
13,"I am addicted to Kershaw speed safe knives. But I must say...this is one of my favorites. I love the sharp tip, the build quality, the size (although not a small pocket knife can easily be carried in the pocket)and the effortless speed safe design. Its a winner.",positive
14,"I purchased this lantern and it worked the first time. The 2nd time, we had a power outage and I went to turn it on. Nothing happened. I changed the batteries. Still nothing. I tried to find out how I could return it. I called and emailed several times with no response. After about 6 weeks, I tried again and a real person answered. I would have to pay almost $9.00 to mailed it back. It's not worth the postage.",negative
15,I got a chance to attend the show and meet Siouxsie Sioux . She was over whelmed by the enthusiasm of the crowd after the show. This is the final album Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded. This is the last show I attended that she played later material from their career.,positive
16,"The title says it all. I have another bread knife and it cuts straight. I have used other bread knives and they cut straight. This bread knife is nice and sharp but it wants to cut a wedge, such that the bottom of the slice is way thicker than the top. I figure the other knives that have know problem pretty much rules out operator error. For me a cheap price for a cooked cutting knife is not a redeeming quality. I guess its better than an expensive crooked cutting knife though. Either one requires the same amount of hassle to repackage and return. Onther note, in my research for the perfect knife I have found allot of preference for a 10"" blade. IMO an 8"" blade is fine for a loaf up to 8""wide. And another One other note, I was disappointed to see it arrive in a box that could have easily fit 50 of these knives. (about 16""X12""X8"") Very wasteful for my green sensibilities. The packaging is not the fault of the knife of course. The product was from Amazon.",negative
17,I purchased this vacuum and will need to return it after one use. The suction on the vacuum doesn't work and I tried to call but there was no response - they said they have a phone problem and dont know when it will be fixed! They said there will be quite a delay in the response. I was excited to get the product but now won't consider it again! Time to package it up and send it back. Wonder if there is anyone there to get the vacuum? I hope I get a full refund,negative
18,"I found the music to be uninspired, repetitious, and just way too mellow. The breathy, overly earnest delivery just put me to sleep. He grabs a groove and just runs it into the ground, track after track. True auditory Valium.",negative
19,"The author's whole premise is flawed. Fr. Seraphim Rose always emphatically stated that the ""toll-houses"" are METAPHORICAL, to illustrate a GENERAL teaching (and there's plenty of patristic and liturgical reference to the METAPHORICAL tollhouses within Orthodoxy well before the modern age). Thus sweeping accusations of ""gnosticism"" are pointless. I suggest any serious inquirer read Fr. Seraphim's writings himself.",negative

21,"I was very disappointed in the sound quality of this CD. It would be different if I had paid only a few dollars, but to pay [this much] for a CD and to have to turn the volume all the way up to hear is ridiculous.",negative
22,"Musiq is such a phony.Come on,dude comes out on the scene with faux-""boho"" style and tagging alongside The Roots and Erykah Badu all while his music is the same sounding R&B mush that dominates urban radio.Add to that,corny lyrics and bad singing and then you got Musiq!!! ""Juslisen"" is 'jusbad"" if you know what I mean.Musiq needs to go back to Philly and maybe get a 9 to 5 at a cleaners or maybe he can hone his musical skills 'cause it's just not working! Nobody said it and it had to be said!",negative

24,"I've been looking for iPhone-compatible earphones for a while, since the included Apple earphones keep falling out (must be something odd about my ears). I didn't want to give up the microphone and the v-moda duo (with mic) are backordered, so I figured if these were originally $30-$40, I'd give them a try. Unfortunately, the sound quality is nowhere near the Apple headset -- it's resonant, kind of like a telephone, there is little bass (and what there is is boomy and... resonant) and there is *no* detail. For $10, it's not worth the trouble to return them and I'll use them as a spare pair, but I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. You do get what you pay for.",negative

26,"This is the two-CD, 7-episode version.The UK version is PAL-encoded with no region restrictions. PAL means it probably won't play in your normal DVD player.There is an option if you want NTSC encoding and Region 1: buy it from canada. Amazon's .ca store has the 10-episode version, and the price is very reasonable (though about double this, once you pay for shipping).",positive
27,"Cannery Row is not Grapes of Wrath, nor is it trying to be. It is simply the most endearing 100 pages I have ever read. For anyone who enjoys this book and has not read Sweet Thursday, stop what you are doing and pick up where Cannery Row left off.",positive

29,"Music and religion were never meant to be used as weapons. This is a terribly biased and narrow-minded example of religious propaganda. Women are degraded, European-Americans are dismissed and the Jewish religion is insulted, I was appalled. I have always enjoyed the undenialble musical talent of Prince, but I cannot tolerate the ""sell,sell,sell"" of a particular ""religious"" point of view. The word ""accurate"" is used more than once in relation to his religious ""opinion"". If you can get beyond the offensive messages, the music is wonderful .",negative

31,"Really liked this book. Displays elevation at destination, altitude gain, distance one way, and which trailhead to use at the beginning of each trail description. Lots of full color photos make it easy to tell your in the right place, but can take away a bit from the element of surprise for what you're going to see when you go there. Only one map in the book, so the purchase of a trail map may also be in order. All in all a good book with short, concise descriptions of trails and what can be seen from them, as well as precautions about altitude, exposure, and other concerns.",positive
32,"I feel that you need to be ""totally fit"" in order to do this workout. Mel B gives no instruction on form and there is very little modification (one woman does not use ""weights"" during the arm section) to the exercises. Also, the exercises are done at a very fast pace and I'm not entirely sure that this is effective for anything other than the cardio sections. Advanced exercises may enjoy the fast pace but those looking for instruction and exercises that build upon each other should look elsewhere.",negative
33,"This massive book is one of the most precious and pretentious pieces of nonsense I've ever seen. Buy it if you hate to cook but love to impress your social-climbing pals. If you love food and love to cook, save your money and buy Elizabeth David's French Provincial Cooking instead.",negative
34,"I have been using this stand for more than five years. Amazon just reminded me about reviewing! This stand is great. Figuring your best way to mount your specific saw to it in the fashion that will suit you the best is your task. I mounted my 10"" Hitachi Sliding Dual Compound saw on a piece of plywood and then to the mounts that came with this stand. I can use the saw on the floor by itself if I want to or quickly mount to the stand.I do think the wheel design could be a bit better but I just carry it over to where I'm going to work anyway! It's light enough to do that but sets up very sturdy with adjustment on one leg for out-of-level situations.Also has a repetitive cut stop but won't work for all applications of course.",positive

36,"My three year old daughter first discovered this puzzle at our library. She fell in love with it and looked for it every time we went. The pieces are the perfect size for her to manipulate. It's very well made. We moved, so I decided to look for it for our home. She's spent hours playing with it at the library--and now even more time playing with it at home.I'm rarely disappointed by Melissa & Doug items.My daughter could manipulate the puzzle from about 2 years old--in case you're wondering if it's suitable for your child. We usually store the pieces right in the puzzle; however, for puzzles with more pieces, we put them in a ziplock baggie which we tape to the back of the puzzle.",positive
37,"I'd reccomend this game only to a young gamer who really likes tanks. There are only 3 tanks to choose from, and only 2 weopon powerups which aren't any good anyway. There are only about 4 different type of enemy which are easy to kill, and no end of stage bosses, Poor music and sound FX, and a unimaginative story line make this game look like it was thrown together over the weekend.

44,"So there are 3 things this product is supposed to do. 1) Play media, 2) Download cheats, 3) Apply cheats. The media player (on mine at least) works fine, but I'm astonished to find no playlist. So you have to hit ""next, play"" after each song. Hardly worth it. The download (ie broadband capability) doesn't work at all. There are numerous documented bugs in thier TCP/IP implementation and repeated attempts to point this out to tech support have ended in me talking to an answering machine. The ""Apply cheats"" part does work (hince the two stars), but you have to enter each 32 digit hex code by hand. And some games have hundreds of cheats to enter. This was the whole point of buying the ""broadband"" edition. In the end, just buy to non-media player, non-broadband edition since these features are useless in this edition.",negative
45,"I'm a big fan of True Crime books, and Ann Rule's in particular. This is one of her best. It was so interesting that I read it in two days, which is really unusual for me. The main story is well paced and never boring. It doesn't cover the trial, which is a nice change from many true crime stories that devote half the book to excruciating trial detail. My only criticism is the author's depiction of Scot Scurlock as just a spirited boy, so talented and handsome. He was an arrogant, extremely self-centered jerk who had no intention of ever making an honest living. I am sure his family described him as brilliant and maybe a little eccentric, but he was a world-class loser. He abused his friendships and was loyal to no one. In the end, he got exactly what he deserved, although the end came far too late.",positive
46,"The disc seemed brand new but it didn't work. My household was looking forward into playing Halo, the first edition as an activity and the result was a disappointing.",negative
47,"The album could be good if it was not for the disappointing fact that on a so called ""Greates Hits"" album her greatest hit (Cambodia) does not appear in the original version.I've read it was for ""time constraints""??? So they did have time to put a ""reprise"" of the song but not the original? Is this a joke?On top of that, the cover does not mention this fact but in the rear side, whereas the front lists the song among the highlights of the album!It is obvious that it had to do either with some producer's rights or with sales policy. In the first case it is her management's duty to bring such things in order. In the latter it is utterly annoying and a lack of respect for fans and customers (I had bought the CD mainly because of this song and was correspondingly disappointed), which is why my rating of this release is: ""I don't like it!""",negative
48,"Even with all the descriptions, measurements and photos, buying a home furnishing online is always a risky proposition. This, easy to assemble, nice looking bookshelf is actually small than I anticipated and, unfortunately, had adhesive marks on the wood that needed to be cleaned off.

51,"I bought this to be able to see all 3 in sequence and follow the story line of musicals. Each movie can stand alone but the sequence of events will be omitted. Supposed time lapse occurs by seeing all 3. No. 1 and No. 2 are about a B value whereas No. 3 is A in my opinion. I enjoyed all 3 and have a very young granddaughter that will watch any of them.

52,"I am trying to be as objective as possible because I know so many people liked the book, but I just didn't like it at all. Like many other have said, if you take out the graphic details of the incest and foul language, you don't have much substance. I think the story line could have been developed much better. I don't agree with some reviewers who say the story isn't plausible. I know there are plenty of young girls like Precious in the world.

58,"I bought this CD right when it came out and I was very disappointed. This is, in fact, Play Part 2. There is nothing fresh here and the played out melodies heard on ""Play"" get quite old here. This album may work for those of you who haven't heard the critically acclaimed ""Play"" because it takes the same formula and basically kills it when comparing the two albums. The first single ""We Are All Made of Stars"" does budge and it does work on certain levels, but it isn't anything to rave about. The appearance of Sinead O'Connor on another track on the album isn't that magnificent either. My recommendation is to definately get ""Play"" (if you don't already have it) and forget that this CD was ever made.",negative

I think he was serious.The Soviet Union did not want war. What would they have to gain by trying to conquer hundreds of millions of unwilling Western Europeans? The USSR feared attack by the US, thus they were forced to spend like mad to try and keep up a comparable military, resulting in economic disaster.

69,After reading The Alchemist I do not understand what all the fuss is about. It reads like a self-help manual and is full of cliches about following your dreams and making them come true.

70,"This guy is great! I heard Sarbacane in 1989 while in France and hassled a woman in a burger van till she told me who he was. His hit tune at the time was 'C'est Ecrit' - a monster! In fact such a monster that I re-wrote the words and recorded an English language version four years later. I don't understand anything of what he's singing (it's non-textbook vernacular French) but the energy is palpable, the melodies are fabulous and I can't believe there are only a handful of people outside France who are into him. Of course, he's sold 1.6 million copies of this album so he's by no means obscure, but it's a crying shame that because he's French he's confined to other French speaking areas of the world. Now if I could get my version of 'C'est Ecrit' - now retitled 'Remember?' - released, who knows? If you've thought French music was all Eurovision bing-tiddle-tiddle-bong, give this guy a listen, he's bound to change your mind!",positive

85,"Sarah McLachlan is the best thing out of Canada since Hockey! Her voice is beautiful, her lyrics are powerful and playful. I loved this album! Song like Possesion and Ice Cream should get her into the Rock'n'Roll hall of fame, right next to the Beatles.",positive
86,Always enjoyed this movie. Good one to watch if you like the 80's. Too bad no one has thought of doing a remake of the movie.,positive
87,"I'm always on the lookout for a good video series, particularly for young adults. Some have great content, but are damaged by cheesy presentation or horrible production values. This series by Tim Keller is one of the best I've seen, and we're getting a lot out of it.",positive
88,"Does anyone in this forum own a Pioneer Blu-ray player. I purchased ""Out of Africa"" (Dual DVD and Blu-ray on Single Disk). The DVD version plays great and completely error-free. Unfortunately that is not the case with the Blu-ray version. I've been trying for months to get the blu-ray version to ""LOAD"" .. and much to my regret (even with all of the latest / recent firmware updates) .. I still keep getting the ""unknown disk - cannot play this disk"" error message. Any input greatly appreciated. Thanks, Helen More (Marlborough, MA)",negative
89,"The average customer review for this film here is 3-and-1/2 stars, which could only mean that the majority of reviewers actually like this film. This makes a mockery of many reviewers' claim that TRL is only appreciated by a small, intellectually superior minority. And by the twisted reasoning of these same people, who hold that a popular movie must be a bad movie, then TRL must indeed be pretty bad. And if it's true that the majority opinion about many films is often initially misguided, only to be changed and revised over subsequent years, then the passage of time will see The Thin Red Line recognized for the pretentious drivel that it is.",negative

92,"I played this game at E3 and it was horrible. It was the only game in its area of the show without a line of people waiting to play it. Unless it's revamped by Titus before its release date, I would recommend staying away from this thing. It needs major, major work. It's kind of a bummer because I'm a big Top Gun fan and thought this would be a great game on PS2.",negative
93,"I found this collection of Pharcyde music videos and tid-bit interviews to be entertaining and infuriating. First and fore most, I must say that the quartetes music videos are indeed bizzare rides, full of witty lyrical energy and interesting conceptual premise. Many compilations (as this one) are fast ways for artists to cash-in on previous successes, but what seperates Cydeways from others is that it attemts to delve into what caused The Pharcyde to break up. Initially, the remaining trio (Tre-who has since left the group, Imani, boody brown) show little audacity towards fatlip for leaving but then they paint him as a red faced clown in one of the videos. Fatlip continues to embarrass himslef with his solo work ""worst case scenario"" which makes me suspect that he never wrote any of the lyrics on previous Pharcyde recordings. With all that said, I am still a fan of the Pharcyde and this DVD is a must have for any one who can say the same.",positive
94,"This is one of the lost treasures of the American Theater. Once one of the most produced plays by high schools and colleges it has lost stature and is only produced occasionally. The reasons for this are a mystery to me.As an actor's exercise it offers performers (particularly young ones) a chance to stretch and discover different cultural types.Based on the ballad ""Barbara Allen"" the play about a love affair and marriage between a Witchboy and a beautiful young woman is highly theatrical and filled with a mystical and earthy quality. Appalachian characters and traditional mountain songs add to the color and whimsical nature of the story.",positive

98,"I had to edit this review since the thermostat broke, the unit does not turn off. After resetting it works as it should through one cycle then fails to shut the appliance off, good thing I checked, cost me a fortune in electricity though. All I wanted was a simple cooling, line voltage thermostat for a greenhouse, I got this for about the same price. It comes loaded with features, it will make you wish you got more, unless it fails to work. You can roughly set the offset temperature too which adds to the versatility of the thermostat, this too does not work as it should, would be good if it did. I can now buy a large inexpensive space heater and set it to heat whenever I want without having to touch it, in theory. It has been two months since got it, I noticed the problem, tried to fix it by setting and resetting the unit, now it is too late to return it. Amazon won't seem to take it back. Five stars if it worked.",negative
99,"I've been playing guitar forever, and writing songs for years, but like most other writers I get stuck in ruts from time to time. Now, whenever I need some new ideas, whether an entire song, a verse, a chorus, a bridge, or a lift, I just look through this book. Even a basic I-IV-V can be made more interesting by advancing or delaying a change. I also like that he relates the CD examples to particular musical styles, which provides a good template for writing to that style.As with Rooksby's other books, the material is presented with great clarity and is well edited. A songwriter could do a lot worse than build a library of his books.",positive

101,"I originally gave this product one star because I was getting 90kbps downloads and 7 kbps uploads. After a call to tech support, they walked me through the process of reinitializing the modem and reactivating/reinstalling it. This sped things up again, but, over time or when I travel, I seem to have to repeat this process a lot to keep a decent speed.",negative

103,"Do not buy this box set, buy the individual seasons and save enough money for a tank or two of gas. I paid $72.99 one day, the next day the price went up to $111 and then not 30 mins later it was $102. You can buy the 3 individual seasons for $15 all day long. $45 vs $102 for the same content is a no brainer.BTW, season 2 has two disc 3's and no disc 1. This has happened to me twice. Also, Amazon has a super return policy. I received my replacement set before I could get the second set in the mail. So, Warner Bros gets 1 star and Amazon gets 5.",negative
104,"4 and 1/2 stars. Purchased for use with 60GB Video iPod.Pros:1. Big plus - LCD display allows for easy reading regardless of light conditions.2. Charges iPod while plugged in.3. Quality product from a quality brand.4. Price point very competitive when compared to similar products of lesser quality.5. Easy to program.Cons:1. Some minor static noticed if iPod is shifted around while in use.2. Product dependant upon empty radio stations in your area (which may or may not be a problem in some areas.)3. Tying into #2 above, you can only pre-set 3 channels. If in a large city, you may have to re-program the device to fit your location.Overall:Highly recommended, especially when compared to similar products that you might find at your local electronics store.",positive
105,"Jimmy Buffet has been pulling the same self-indulgent B.S. for the last 30 years. It's amazing that people buy this crap, but then they also wear mullet haircuts and buy mobile homes.Quit supporting marketing driven horse hockey. There are artists like James McMurtry, Robert Earl Keene and John Hiatt who deserve your money.",negative
106,"My wife bought a bunch because they were (for a time) the only BPA-free bottles she found (frankly didn't look that hard)They are decent bottles yes, but there is this extra pair of pieces which you have to assemble. I don't see that they do anything for reducing swallowed air or anything else, but they're fidgety and just extra pieces to clean.It might not sound so bad but it more than doubles the amount of work to fill a bottle, and at 3 AM when you have a screaming baby, you don't want to be diddling around with the extra pieces.BE WARNED - Replacement nipples are $7.50 a pair and they last only a month or two before they need to be replaced (The holes enlarge and let too much flow out) There are MUCH CHEAPER and simpler / better designed bottles out there - you just have to look.The sippy cups are another story entirely. They are a disaster.",negative
