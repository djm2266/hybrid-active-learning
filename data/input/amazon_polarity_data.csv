1,"This is my favorite kind of book -- one that holds me rapt with a fast-paced, entertaining story while also indulging my love of language with beautiful, lyrical passages and vivid, memorable imagery. The Deeper, The Bluer celebrates the everyday heroism of single mothers and made me proud to be both a mother and a woman. I couldn't put this wonderful book down and ended up reading it in one sitting! My recommendation? Buy it and keep it. This author is going to be big, big, big -- and when that happens you'll have a first edition of her first book",positive
2,"I've had an older model RM65 that I picked up second hand for about a year. I use it for my job, which involves recording spoken word. I have been craving a mic/instrument mixer that is only one rack space and phantom power that's selectable per channel so I can use a variety of mics. This has it all. It's incredibly compact, has pots for monitor, bass, treb, pan, fx send. Has trim pots on back. The enclosure is nice and sturdy. My only complaint is that the older model that I have did not have a headphone monitor. This has been remedied I hear in recent models.This unit is great for this price point. If you want some kind of a very rough thumbnail of how it stacks up, I think it compares very favorably to similar Behringer equipment.",positive

5,"I've bought several of these wireless headphones because I enjoy walking around and/or lying in bed while listening to TV. Compared to other headphones, the sound quality is fine.

7,"Another great band from when bands were at their best, the 60s & 70s produced the Very BEST!!! The Band: MOODY BLUES produced the best listening music. You could be laying around your place drinking your wine and just listening or even without the wine, it was a pleasure to listen to.",positive
8,"When I ordered this CD as a gift for my father, the Amazon.com page advertised this CD as a CDG....a CD with GRAPHICS. Upon opening the gift, the outside cover indeed said CDG, however, the inner sleeve said that ""due to copyright laws, lyrics could not be printed"". We assumed that since this was a CDG, the lyrics would be on the screen while the music was playing, but it was not. I wish that either the producers of the CD or AMAZON.COM would show more discretion on the items they label as CDG.",negative
9,"Please if you love the Brothers Johnson DO NOT BUY THIS. Absolutely one of the worst recordings I've seen and heard. It sounds like it is straight from the board with no mixing. Louis is so low in the mix, just a shame. Half of the band is just kinda on the smooth jazz or gospel chops tip... horrible. God I love the Brothers Johnson, a huge fan, but this is well... lol... HORRIBLE.",negative
10,"I bought this series for my adultndaughter. I curse that day! The quality is great for the product but what a horrible bunch of people!

It's just hilarious and heart warming at the same time. What really surprises me is that more people aren't watching or are not aware of the show. Oh, well they are missing out because this show is a true gem. Can't wait until the dvd hit shelves, so I can can share it with some more friends!",positive

17,"A playful plashless recording. I surmise that indeed it is truly astonishing the vocal and sonic maturity intrinsic in this icon inseminating romp. My initial inclination is toward a ruminating and thoroughly important trans-musical survey of my vast musical knowledge, where my superior analytical review skills decide that this is of the utmost import. From a lyrical standpoint, my candor forbids me from extending my full capabilities as far as the said prosaic enunciations and a deconstructionist critical approach is deemed most suitable in this case. Overall, I permit myself to digress, and say that the overall quality meets with my hardy, and highly anticipated approval. And I look forward to hearing more from the young lads. Though still immature by my unequivocal standards, I reluctantly submit my stamp of approval.",negative
18,"This book is somewhere between a test prep and a linux manual...The beauty of the LPI certification is that it is new, making ""test prep"" books hard to compile. What this book does is present the information required in the LPI exam objectives in a realistic order... not in a 101 and 102 section.While this seems to have upset some people, if one stops and thinks about the presentation it makes sense to keep like topics together to LEARN the topic, not to seperate into two sections of a book dependant information (thus teaching the TEST)This book carefully presents the reader with all the information he/she will require to pass the LPI Level I exams (101 & 102)",positive

21,I completely enjoyed these books. I think what most people are forgetting is that these are very early King works and do not reflect his style today. If you enjoy pure graphic horror then you will enjoy these novels. If you want more laid back scares then go with some of Kings later works.,positive
22,"I though the book was intresting and ended w/ a bang. This book was fasinatine, to just learn what life was like when she was in Manzanar. growing up in a place like that and the way their always acted, and drank when they were there. Then the way they would always get situated and have to move again. Someone would have to have so much courage to do that and, then to have to go throuhg it again?This book made me realize how badly Japaneese were treated when Parol Harbor was going on and how they were discriminated aginst juts because they were different. They were loked up in a camp just because the people that attacked , were like them they were thought to be bad people to . They couldn't do anything about it. They couldn'ttell them they didn't like to be treated like that. it just simply took courage!! 7.2J.T",positive

27,"OK, we get it already, Ms. Monseur: Paris is a tormented, tough, sometimes gentle woman who can't decide which part of her anatomy to think with. This book had all the elements of a wonderful thriller; full of creepy but sympathetic characters and a sound plot. Save one thing; by the last third of the book. I got bogged down. In endless, mind-numbing detail. Every sentence stacatto. Fragmented segments. It was like she ran out of energy. Needed to fill space. I'll paraphrase: ""She opened her makeup drawer. Withdrew the shiny cylinder of lipstick. Pulled off the silver top. Swiped her bottom lip once. Swiped her top lip once. Smacked them together."" Not a direct quote, but the kind of detail that really bogged me down. Really is a pity. She wrote two excellent books. Now she seems to think she can ""phone them in.""",negative

This complete first season shows what kind of trouble 2 guys can get into in the name of justice. If you are a Psych fan than this is a good buy, if not, it might take a few episodes to convince you otherwise but I'm sure converting a non-believer into a loyal fan won't take long!!! Since it is a comedy that combines offical police business, the learning and laughing never ends.",positive

32,"Predictable, cliché, sappy and no character depth. What a waste of time and money! I can't believe anyone gave this peice of trash a five star review.

35,"Their previous CD, Grace and Gravity, turned out to be one of my favorite recordings of 1992. The Angel in the House is even better, a really remarkable CD in terms of both performance and sound. The Story were Jonatha Brooke and Jennifer Campbell, two women with marvelous voices who were able to blend them in quirky yet appealing harmonies. They often appeared as an acoustic duo, but on their recordings, they were backed up by a crack group of musicians. On The Angel in the House, there are some really effective uses of percussion, often offering surprising transitions of style. The Story were able to make music that is at the same time immediately melodic and accessible but yet full of musical twists and turns. The depth and complexity of this music demands that it be played over and over again. This is an exceptionally rewarding CD both musically and sonically, a real hidden treasure.",positive

37,"I have mixed opinions about this product. Although I felt really well in the first weeks, in the 6th and 7th weeks of my pregnancy I felt super bad after taking these vitamins. During those weeks when I was more susceptible to nausea and vomiting, I felt even worse after taking these vitamins. The smell, the taste of pills made me feel really sick in my stomach. Actually when I was vomiting I tasted the bad flavor of this product in my mouth. Today I would not recommend these vitamins. Furthermore, be careful if you are taking these vitamins associated with Rainbow 1 DHA. Please watch your vitamins intake because the excess of some vitamins may be dangerous for you and your baby.",negative

39,"WHAT DOES THIS BOOK HAVE to do WITH ME? Very much if you have a time deposit, own a mutual fund, or even just a checking account. You'll learn what all banks and funds do with YOUR MONEY by reading Lowenstein's book. Although LTCM was in a league of their own in the world of arbitrage and derivative trading, quite ordinary funds and banks follow some form of this technique. This is a book about how small our planet has become; how much the actions of a few affect us all. This is also, in the end, a gripping tale of human nature--philosopy. It's a great read, but not comforting to anyone who wants the ""experts"" to manage their money. Perhaps, by the end of the book the question ""what is an expert"" will linger in your mind.",positive

42,"Being a fan of revolution era stories I looked high and low for this book. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. It starts out with promise. A very bubbly young miss comes upon a man being hanged by a mob for treason......and saves him by claiming he's a friend of hers. They get away on her little sloop but they inadvertenly get captured by the English. Lord Hazard, an englishman, does all he can to procure her return to annapolis. But then that ship gets captured by an american ship. I read half of the book and they were still on a ship......no romance even insinuated about....and the male character very distanced from the reader. I decided I didn't much care if they ever got off the ship and abandoned it.",negative
43,"After reading the other reviews, I was really looking forward to this collection. I am very disappointed. The sound quality is terrible.

53,"J.Lo's remix album plays just like a regular album. On this album, J.Lo choses the best material from each of her records. The best cuts are ""Ain't It Funny"" which was remixed from the original version to capitalize on her current hip-hop success, ""I'm Real (same reason),"" ""Walking On Sunshine"" which sounds much better than the original version, the Darkchild remix of ""If You Had My Love"" which at times computerizes Lopez's vocal flaws, and ""Alive"" a beautiful ballad that will be featured on her upcoming flick ""Enough."" Even though she sings this song very well, it actually should be left to a better vocalist, since she kind of sounds like a little kid singing at a karoke contest. These remixes are hot, and the truth be known, it's the best remix album so far in my opinion. If I were you, I'd pick this up! Might I add, it's great for working out!",positive

This is typical and easy to forget (thank heaven) sickly sweet and drippy 80's synth pop. This isn't synth pop like later New Order, Ultravox, Ministry's first album or even the Naked Eyes or Tears for Fears....this is Synth pop like something in the background of a low budget 80's teen sex comedy 'new wave' bar scene.... - I will say it's a hair better then anything Wang Chung ever did but only because the singing is so over the top that I actually was cracking up a couple of times with the vocal embellishments and pretention.....",negative

This is not going to happen at Wiley's list price of $126.50. Which is a shame, in more ways than one.

77,"This book brilliantly interweaves all the big issues of politics, science, religion, and philosophy, as they have evolved over the last half century, and as they have affected the lives of a colorful and diverse cast of characters.I particularly appreciated the way the author made each character so believable and three-dimensional; I almost felt that I actually knew these people.Those of a certain age should also enjoy remembering ""the way we were"" -- reflected through movies, radio programs, TV, songs, clothing, cars, architecture, slang, etc.The book was such a feast of sights, sounds and other sensory delights that one reading is not really enough. A very satisfying experience.",positive
78,"There are very few writers who can sustain a humorous novel. It is a talent wildly under-appreciated until one seeks out those few examples of truly funny books: currently, David Lodge, last century, P.G. Wodehouse. A few others. And then there are the Dortmunder novels by Westlake, who takes the mystery genre and turns it into clever, lovable, hilarious adventures of these star-crossed robbers.This one, his most recent, returns to the level of his earlier ones, those memorable ones like the serial robberies in HOT ROCKS and ""bank-robbing"" taken too literally in BANK SHOT and the un-robbery of WHY ME?These are shamelessly shallow feel-good lovable entertainments: a rare accomplishment for any novelist in any period. This one, about DNA and Native Americans' casinos, is a splendid hoot.",positive

It has never missed a beat, which is why when *this* model became available at an even deeper discount in a brick and mortar store, I picked it up immediately. Although I've only had it a a week (and the true test comes over time), it works great. Had a small issue with the integrated wireless connecting to my WEP-protected network. I changed the encryption at the router to WPA-PSK, and it it's worked fine. Although the bundled software isn't terrific, it's adequate, and overall it's free of shovelware.

82,"Silas Marner is a classic Eliot tale which combines comments on morality and religion in a fascinating narrative of life in England during the HeyDay of artisan industry.Truly a story which is as effective in commenting on the religious quandries of a man whose honesty and integrity were not believed by a church hierachy as it is on theeveryday affections of a father and his daughter. Silas is a modern-day tragic hero, with a twist; his tragedy is turned into a fairytale wonder, and the rich nobility ofthe Cass family (the local Squierarchy) have tragedy and sadness.This book is important reading for anyone interested in starting out with Eliot, and more so as a powerful and moving story from which everyone can learn! Silas is not abook which will simply be read once. You will want this hard cover edition to keep in a prominent place on your library shelf so that you'll be able to readit time and time again without damage!Have fun and enjoy.Phillip Miller",positive

86,"The Heir was probably the worst novel Lindsey has written. I'm not a 'die-hard' Lindsey fan, but I must confess that my 'favorite novel list' contain several novels written by her, and I do find her books more than tolerable. However, the Heir did not inherit neither the romance nor action usually associated with Lindsey's earlier novels.Actually, it was so 'boring' that I had to literally force myself to finish the novel.The hero and heroine were 'weak' characters and the menace, 'dear old' Ophelia was obnoxious and dizzy, oh well, as she was written to be. The hero's uncles were just plain 'stupid', the heroines two aunts reminded me of the two aunts in 'Arsenic and Old Lace', and the month long 'search for a bride' party became blase'.After reading The Heir, I decided to read a good old fashioned classical romance to appreciate the fine art of writing.Happy Reading!",negative

The instructors move quickly through the movements without informing you of propper posture, so its easy to hurt your back. The video is misleading because the hot guy on the cover, the ""guest trainer"", talks for about 30 seconds, then you watch a room full of women exercising. The guy comes back at the end and says, ""That was tough, see you tomorrow."" And that's it. I finally got rid of the video because in the workout room there are some ""artsy"" paintings of topless women on the walls. The pictures are not real graphic, but I didn't like my older boys seeing them.

And since then, I never had the opportunity to see it again. But I've always remembered the strange atmosphere of GOTO with the concerto of Haendel playing on Glossia's tearful face.Cult Epics had the great idea of releasing GOTO on DVD, adding as bonus feature ""Les Astronautes"", a short film directed by Borowczyk and Chris Marker in 1959. I was happy to see that the movie ages well and that my memory hadn't added to it the faked beauty of the souvenirs. So I can't but advise you to discover GOTO and his strange characters whose names are Gono, Gonasta, Grozo, Gurto and even Grymp.A DVD zone lost in time.",positive

113,"Ahhh, the good old days where eye-candy wasn't the driving force of RPG and *story* propelled games. Sadly, in retrospect, FF5 seems to get pounded away and lost in the competition it recieves not only from FF 7 & 8, but it's companion FF6 as well. The characters and story in FF5 become as non-exsitant as in FF Tactics, and lacking the battle system FFT had, FF5 fades quickly. The anthology becomes well worth it's price with FF6 though. Characters, story, and dialouge mixed in with enjoyable mini-events keep the attention and intrigue of the player. The music CD is a touch lacking (Celes' theme is missing! What a travesty!) but sufficent enough to keep most happy. FF6 alone would be enough to justify buying this, with the ""bounses"" of the music CD and the ""old-fashioned Tactics"", this is indeed a good purchase.",positive

Why not take a bad movie in remake it ,instead of trying to cash in on the vision of someone elses for profit. The main problem with this joke of a movie is: You can't turn Jack Carter into a caring good-guy. Carter was a ruthless, menacing,selfish killer, not the likeable character Stallone presented. This was a shameful star vehicle that should of fell flat on its rear end. Shame on Caine for showing up in this joke of a movie.",negative
116,"WOW!! I just finished listening to the CD, courtesy of AOL's listening party. It is the best prequel score, and the best Star Wars score since Star Wars Episode V. It must be heard to be believed. We all know that the score for Star Wars Episode II was lacking. Williams makes up for it this time. My only complaint is that there isn't enough classic stuff: not enough Imperial March and I was hoping that the male choir piece that plays for Darth Sidious in Star Wars Episode VI would make an appearance. However, THIS CD alone is one of Williams' best work. The new theme, 'Battle of the Heroes' that plays throughout is awesome. One fianl note: at Celebration III it was said that next year, there might be a prequel bxed set of the complete score. So, 2 CDs for each film (Episodes I-III) makes a six disc set. I hope so, because while the prequel trilogy music is awesome, give us the complete score!",positive

It did not provide any tips on this - it recommended the usual distraction, take them on a long walk, etc but didn't provide any information you could get from common sense or a quick internet search.In the section where people wrote letters explaining their issues with their children, I felt like the advice was light. Often, they recommended getting a babysitter as the solution to the problem. Also, I think it is important to note this book was written 30 years ago and had a lot of outdated references.

149,"At a yard sale, a friend was offered .50 cents for her ""Judy Live at Carnegie Hall"" album. She refused and said she could not believe that someone would have the gall to offer so little. She loaned me the 2 record set and I simply fell in love with the divine Miss Garland. It was without a doubt the night that the art of entertainment worked to the MAX. Judy makes you smile and makes you cry tears and if you think of her tragic life maybe a few more tears. Through it all, you must remember that you are listening to one of the World's Premiere Entertainers. Yea, even better than over-hyped Streisand. When I purchased the re-mastered CDs from ... I began to feel that I had attended the concert because it is a live recording with all the stories and asides from Garland, and musicians bumping microphones and of course the ambience of Carnegie Hall. Buy this CD and enjoy the best performance in the history of Entertainment. It is not to be missed.",positive

Neither have any signs of physical abuse, but they just crap out. This is really disappointing because its such a great product, if only they could build it better.

Whereas, Maximus in Gladiator, for example, goes through changes, Leonidas does not. There's fighting, there's more fighting, and still more fighting. Which doesn't give the viewer any opportunity for emotional involvement. Or watching the character develop as the story progresses. The characters are flat and one-dimensional and that is my biggest complaint. But the visuals will blow you away.",positive

165,"After a disappointing look through other mammal field guides, I came across this little gem. Instead of illustrations it uses photos (except for the whales, some illustrations). I almost passed on it because I wasn't used to seeing these kinds of photographs in a field guide: they are digitally edited and have the appearance of being cut out and pasted onto the white pages. However, it soon became clear that the photos are of exceptional quality and could beat out the competetion as far as completeness of subject matter. For example: there are about fifty photos of chipmunks; there are photos of both morphs of the Arctic Fox in summer and winter. Two variations of the blue phase are shown in summer coat. The pups for both colors are included.The book is designed well, with the text most of the time to the left of the corresponding pictures. Fun, interesting, informative.",positive
166,"It's frustrating to know that a talent as exceptional as N'Dea Davenport is still bubbling under mainstream's radar screen. The onetime lead vocalist for the UK soul outfit Brand New Heavies, Davenport is gifted with pipes that stand tall next to those of her more commercialized peers. In 1998, she unleashed her fine self-titled debut album which demonstrates growth from her days with BNH. I find it hard to resist the jazzed-up ""Whatever You Want,"" the electronic bleeps of the funky ""No Never Again,"" and the love jam ""Under a Red Moon."" But she doesn't really let up wintil we get to ""Bull-------,"" a spicy mid-tempo jam with sass and attitude. The disc hits just a few weak spots with the ballads, but on the whole, this is a smart solo debut that's light on gloss and heavy on substance.",positive

This book contains the following, a very confusing tedious test to take, buying 50 or more supplements, taking these supplements all day at different times during several months, jumping on trampolines, and eating cruciferous veggies. Very nutty in that it wont tell you what day would look like on the diet or what foods you can eat, and it seems the publisher here has a vested interest in you buying these supplements.

After owning a HP840c, buying ink for this one is really inexpensive.Also, it works great in Red Hat Linux 9. The reason I mention it is because this is a USB Printer, and was worried about not having the appropiate drivers for Linux, but Red Hat 9 comes with S300 drivers and those work.",positive

My parents bought it for me for Christmas, and although it took forever to get all the little stickers on, I haven't has a problem getting this toy to stay together. It spends the majority of its time on a shelf, but it does get some play from my friends' kids. The balconies and such seem to be made to ""break away"" and fall apart rather than actually snap off, but the kids seem to learn real quick how to put it back together. Based on other reviews though, I suspect that Hasbro released this toy a little too early, without a decent amount on consumer testing.

This is a down-to-earth writing which brings the common man to a comfort level where he order from a wine list without sweating.The book's construction as part-course and part-antidotal is very smartly done. Immer offers some great tips about how to navigate your way through wine in store and restaurants and how to know one bottle from another. She encourages trying new things and offers a whole bunch of recommendations.The greatest thing, though is that she offers timeless lesson plans here. There is no list of essential wines to buy or drink, and she doesn't force here personal preferences on the reader.The one downside is that, to truly maximize enjoyment of this book, you need to invest in the wine tastings and comparisons spelled out inside - I suggest making this book a group activity.",positive

Like, the sassy and dazzling cajun tune ""I Wear You're Love"", another upbeat song, ""Kiss This"" and no that is not the Aaron Tippin song, the beautiful song, ""I Don't Know Why"", and truely the best song on the album, a song Lisa wrote about her own experience with a cheating man, this is a very emotional song, ""I Didn't Want To Know"". The rest of the songs are not bad, they just aren't good, they're listenable but with the four songs I just mentioned, it's worth it. All in all it seems like Lisa is trying a little too hard and maybe she tried to cover too much ground on her first outing.",positive

230,"I have heard many compare LA's hippest trio to the famous Larry Goldings organ trio Back East. Though they do share some qualities, I think Anthony Wilson's trio stands by itself. Originality, creativity, swing-feel, repertoire, and ""outness,"" are all things that set Wilson's trio apart from Goldings'. This is not to say Goldings' trio does not do these things. Lord knows they do it as good, if not better than anyone, but the guys in Anthony's trio do the same things with their own spin. I also think Joe Bagg and Mark Ferber communicate to each other on their instruments as good as anyone in the business. This Groove Note release is a great example of some of the things this trio can do. As with most musicians, the experience is really felt when it is live! The same holds true for this amazing group, but their great sound is captured on this wonderful album. I thoroughly enjoyed it from front to back. I totally recommend buying it.",positive

On the day I received the pan, I used it to boil pasta and to cook frozen spinach. The pour and strain feature was wonderful, and the lid of the pan allows you to choose between two sizes of drain holes. The only thing I don't like about the pan is that it takes a while for water to heat to boiling. Otherwise, it is a very attractive and functional product. I'll probably buy the two quart size as well.",positive

I think it should be required reading for every high school student in the United States.Its' harsh reality points out the stupidity of racism. A man can love a woman, have five childrn with her, and yet, he is not allowed to marry her! To me, racism is the worst form of insecurity. The author did a good job but at times it was very confusing. She didn't put enough information about each woman. I had to keep going back to see who she was talking about.If you enjoyed this book, I think you would enjoy 'Sing Me A Bawdy Song.' It is written in the same way about an American family living from 1917 to 1945. The book is 70% true and you will find yourself laughing and crying. It is easy to read and all the reviews are begging for more.",positive

Here's the real problem i have with the author: in his books he never mentions what companies or corporations he is/was involved. He keeps on preaching Real Estate, but if you do some research you find out that his true income comes from the books that he sells. The background check also states that the book is more fiction than anything else( so please dont give me the garbage of the TRUE STORY of rich dad and poor dad).",negative

This is a book that explains this complex country in an authoritative and extremely accessible way, written by an American journalist who has traveled there repeatedly for the last 20 years. Her empathy, perceptiveness and even affection are on vivid display. An NPR interviewer in Seattle called it a ""page-turner."" And so timely! It captures the intense drama that is playing out today in Iran--a battle between Islam and democracy--at a time when we still don't know the ending. But the best stuff is about women in Iran--the hair salons, aerobics studios, fashion design houses, kitchens, swimming pools. Written with great voice, and charm.",positive
246,"I expected more from one of my favorite lead singers. A couple songs are good, but it wasn't worth it buying the whole album.

It is noticably not as catchy as The Power Out, which, probably I will be the only person that misses that. I like catchy. Especially the way that one was catchy. With hooks so smart, if I were a fish I wouldn't mind losing my life to hooks like that. I would snap on. I would take the bait. They could reel me in.Axes is starker, and more Stockhausen, which is always popular with modern minds, not always mine. It's what John Cale's Paris 1919 should have sounded like, and was so disapointing and boring because it didn't. And it's a lot like that final, two-album leap that Talk Talk made when they transcended everything, when they abandoned pop for good and went free. I hope Electrelane stick around though.",positive

257,"As a survivor of the pornography industry I can state clearly that this book does not give an accurate representation of pornography or of it's effects on the people who are victimized by it. Strossen tries to cleverly rephrase porn into a context where it is presented as liberation as freedom and as a symbol of women's rights. But porn is none of those. Porn is violence against women and children.My feeling is that this book reads like a court room drama hearing from only one attorney, one viewpoint and eliminating all of the victims.Andrea Dworkin has several titles which accurately represent the reality of porn. A reality that I knew first hand. A reality that has left me scarred for life. All of the gloss on Ms. Strossen's arguments about pornography being liberating and pro women will do nothing toward healing my scars or those of other victims of porn.",negative

Unfortunately, attempts at humor seem to overtake the experimentation, making the album sound like a joke that's not all that funny. ""I Buy the Drugs"" is still quite catchy and is a preview of good things to come on future releases, and ""Pulling the Plug on the Party"" could have been right at home on ""Senor Smoke"". ""Night Vision"" is another standout, but still pales in comparison to some of E6's better music. Outside of those three, I can't recommend too much here.",negative

287,"All of the Le Carre novels involve the theme of betrayal and exploitation in some subtle manner. This is one where the main character, as actress, has to betray and exploit herself. She - and by implication, we as readers - never know what is authentic and what is artifice in her. Le Carre demolishes the distinction. For this very quality she is taken on by the Israeli secret service, who need to construct an elaborate but plausible facade. Like all Le Carre's other novels there's an ambivalence about what is right and wrong. The characters are complex, ofttimes confusing in their motives and unsure of the efficacy and rightness of what they're doing. What makes this book unusually troubling is Le Carre's exposure of the fakeness and schism in the soul of western man.Is there anything bona fide and clear about us? Is life for us just theatre?",positive

At first, it seemed like a snoozer as I paged through it at the library, but I added it to our pile anyway. It seemed timely, if nothing else since it was winter here. My daughter surprised me later when we opened it at home. Before I began reading, she pointed furiously at the pictures. ""Boots!"" She said as she identified the little girl's snow gear. Same with her scarf and snowsuit. She then proceeded to imitate the pictures pretending to catch snowflakes on her eyes, her hand and her tongue, saying ""yum, yum"" along as I read. She even learned how to make a snow angel from the illustration. When we were done, I often got her little ""again"" to go back to the beginning. So, I was wrong. It was a hit. A very soft-spoken, gentle rhyme and picture book that captures the magic of falling snow for toddlers.",positive

A best selling novelist kills married couples on their first night in their hotel rooms after the wedding ceremonies and then sexually abuses the dead brides. This killer also abuses his several spouses. The author also creates a policewoman with a terminal illness and the secondary plot of her battle with her ailment which adds little to the storyline while she strives to solve this absurd tale of a serial murderer.

I won't go into the details of this movie (others have) but IF you want to watch a film where the acting is top rate and the story line so good that it seems real, check this movie out. It's a keeper.",positive
308,"Oh, Mr. Costner, you are so handsome and a fine actor, so it pains me to listen to your CD. It's more egotistical than ""The Postman."" I know that it is/was a trend for actors to make records. I would urge people to get a copy of the tape of some fine actors singing, well not so fine, songs. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Mae West, Jack Webb, hey they all took a turn, why shouldn't Kevin? Kevin shouldn't because he is a talented actor and should stick to what he does well.I suppose I should give him credit for stretching his artistic wings, but some well meaning producer should have stopped him.Looking forward to your next movie, Mr. Costner, but not your next CD.",negative

It dares to restore the name of God to the text where other versions capitalize (About 5000 some-odd times) the word ""LORD"", furthering the Jewish and Christian superstition that THE NAME is too holy to utter. It transliterates the Hebrew word; ""Sheol"" in place of the misunderstood translations of grave, hell, and pit. The New Jerusalem Bible has been my favorite version for many years.

What is surprising is that there isn't a single reference to Paul Burrell, Diana's butler so recently in the headlines and whom she apparently called her ""rock."" So many people have written ""inside"" stories about Diana and one has to wonder who really were her confidants and who have simply been capitalizing on the employer/employee relationship. Mr. Wharfe, despite his altruistic assertions as to his reasons for writing, has obviously hoped to profit from time spent in her service.",negative
320,Having first seen this film at university twenty years ago I was really looking forward to watching this scary but masterful political propaganda film once again but my copy was a dud. About 70 minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies. The images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued. Then the sound froze. I had to keep fast forwarding to get through the glitches. QA could not have been to rigorous. The digital reproduction on the DVD is poor at this point and this continues throughout the whole of the SS review.I'll be asking for my money back.,negative

I went on line and found the VAST majority of customers are unhappy wit this product for the same reason. With the Kitchen Aid name, and the connection to Hobart, I assumed that this would be a quality product. It is certainly more expensive than the other brands.

I guess. But that doesn't work, it just makes you start to hate the movie. Man, when you have the opportunity to completely take out the monster/enemy, you don't just give it a little whack then half-heartedly limp along, you make sure that thing can never get up and come after you again! This movie gets a big FAIL for insulting the audience and treating both the audience and lead character with disrespect. Back to class with you.",negative

And all the recycled tricks, the pick scrapes, the echoey screams, the talk box... just tired. Still a great band, still great live, just not a fantastic album. Of course, most Tool fans are so diehard it will take them at least ten years to realize this but hey, whatever floats your toolboat.",negative
335,"After a very solid ""Face Up"", I was so looking forward to the release of ""The Moment"" from Soul Diva Lisa Stansfield. I was very surprised listening to this CD that there is not one song on this CD that is in the R&B vein. This is a straight up Pop adult contemporary album. Lisa is in fine voice as usual, however, the production and selected material leaves a lot to be desired. And judging by the U.K.'s lackluster reception for this CD, many of her fans feel the same. And I'm sure once again, this CD will fail to gain a domestic release. For those of you looking for the 'soulful' return of this songbird, you won't find it here.",negative

Jonatha Brooke has a lovely voice, in my opinion, and her music has a quaint but soothing feel to it.She's still early in her career, but it seems like she's getting a sizeable fan crowd. Our goal is to get the people here at our college to know about her. I think she's making progress.This CD is different from her last one, and it seems to have disappointed several people. I guess it's kind of confusing when singers change their style from CD to CD, but I think she's just trying out different styles.I would compare her to Beth Orton, Alice band, Turin Brakes, and a little bit of Norah Jones' style. So if you are familiar with any of those artists, you might want to check out Jonatha Brooke.",positive

For me though, the cuts that they made for the theatrical release do not stop me from enjoying these movies as I also enjoyed them in the theater.Why only 4 stars?

385,"My husband and I loved this movie. It is wholesome, funny, and teaches lessons. Its about God telling this guy to build an ark in modern day times. Its about his willingness to be faithful and to do what he is called to do even when he doesnt understand and about his family supporting him. It teaches us how to listen and follow God, how His plans are not ours, and combines it with funny humorous moments throughout the movie. I laughed out loud. One scene shows him sitting on the couch with a fish tank behind him and the fish follow him no matter where he sits(because he's the modern Noah), as he trys to shoo them away! So funny, you have to see it.This is the kind of comedy we need, not more sexual, nasty mouthed comedy. This movie was refreshing and so fun to watch!!!",positive
386,"i enjoy this cd a lot because it reminds me alot of the blind guardian album night fall on middle earth (i belive thats what it's called i'm to lazy to look at my cd's) i would have to say there are some slow parts to the music, but the talent of the band makes up for everything.",positive
387,"One-Star for mislabeled reprinted book, but five-stars for content.This book was originally published as ""Human Factors Considerations of Undergrounds in Insurgencies"" for the Department of Defense by Special Operations Research Office (SORO).Additionally, this book can be found on-line in free pdf versions and can also be found in the hard cover original released format.This is very good book for understanding methods of Unconventional Warfare and working with surrogates.",negative
388,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer. This movie is just about as bad as it gets. A boring, senseless script with bumbling ""actors"", silly dialogue, and production values that would embarrass a high-school film project are all combined in this typical Ulli Lommel project. Lommel really should look for work in another field, as he clearly has no idea how to produce a film worth watching. Ed Wood's worst film is a masterwork compared to this steaming heap of trash. The real zombies are the hacks who produced this mess.",negative
389,Although I have played hl2 this version will not load and play.I have updated drivers and reinstalled the game but nothing.The bad part is that you cannot get help from steam.Steam has ruined a good game once again,negative

391,"I ordered this as a christmas present and it turned out to be a duplicate. I emailed the company right away on the 26th....no response. As I type this, I am sitting on hold letting the phone ring and ring until someone answers.....44 minutes and counting. This shipped from Electronics Expo in New Jersey. I would not order this product again in a hundred lifetimes if this is the service I receive.",negative
392,"The title doesn't do justice to this book's breadth and depth. ""Birds at Your Feeder"" consists of ornithologically informed and delightfully written accounts of the feeding habits, behavior, distribution, and abundance of 93 North American species that often visit bird feeders. I bought the book knowing nothing more about it than Dr. Dunn's international prominence as an ornithologist at the Canadian Wildlife Service and a prime developer of Project FeederWatch -- and I wasn't disappointed. She and her co-author based the book solidly on an analysis of the data submitted by thousands of observers since 1987 in the immense network of FeederWatch volunteers across the U.S. and Canada. It seems to me that this important publication has not received the wide attention it deserves. A broad range of readers from professionals in ornithology to people with little more than a casual interest in backyard birds should find it both entertaining and worthwhile.",positive
393,Tried this on Macs with system 9.2 & X.Functions will not performs as described and are very awkward at best.I would be willing to bet that Mr. Frampton did not learn the guitar using this DVD.,negative

395,"I bought the original release last year and so far there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it.Was it a technical problem? Was extra content added? What? Would somebody please shed some light on this?Thanks!R.V.-oh, yes: this DVD is just awesome.",positive
396,"My name is Robert Davis and I got this game from a freindwho did'nt want it, so he gave it to me. This game ROCKS!The graphices are great and the games you can play are AWESOME!My favroit are the Death Matchs. I like having allies when Iplay because it's fun to see Trade Carts going back and forthbetween your and your allies Markets. The instruction bookletis really detailed so if your in a jam just pause the gameand bring it out. The fighting is good because the good graphices( they don't just go up to each other and just standthere, you see them swinging their swords!) This game Ihighly recommend to any fan of Lord of the Rings the movie.They have a lot in common. GET THIS GAME AS SOON AS YOU SEETHIS REPORT, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!",positive
397,"I purchased these radios a month ago. The range of these radios is outstanding. The clarity is superb. The call feature is useful and so is the scan button. There are two buttons on the side this can be confusing. The top button is used to talk and the bottom is used to turn the squelch off. (So you can monitor very weak signals) At first it was hard to get used to, but after a while it becomes second nature. Extremely great value for the price.",positive
398,"A little larger than I am used to and had a hard time finding a place in the kitchen to keep them handy but out of the way. They work great, never got warm no matter how long I used them in a roaring hot oven. Easy to wipe off and easy to get on and off. The extra length works fantasic for times like Thanksgiving when the oven is stuffed and have to reach all the way back for things.",positive
399,"Great movie! Image quality was fantastic too. But i'm really disappointed that it's only a streaming movie file which means that i must have internet connection to watch it. For $14 I expected to have a completely downloaded file to my computer that i can play when or wherever i want. (for the kids on a long road trip for example)I was so mad. If i knew before hand that i would not have full access to the movie then i would not have purchased $14 dollar movie that could only watch ""sometimes"".",negative
400,"Dr DeRosa's book was entertaining, easy to read and packed with anecdotes and information. As an investment pro, his book gave me a greater insight into the often arcane political manipulations that eventually sow the seeds for economic instability. He pulls no punches when he states that central banks and governments themselves set themselves up to be the eventual ""victims"" of their own bad policies and instead of doing something different, they blame the speculator.I like his information ""boxes"" that help the reader with the technical details of the book. Although I have long been a fan of single currency idea's, DeRosa's book has given me reason to pause. Well referenced and well researched.The reviews by Dr Hanke and Dr Friedman can't hurt either.",positive
401,"I enjoyed the dog training angle, even though I'm not sure I agree with his theories. I just find it hard to believe they would work in the real world with real dogs.What I didn't like was his apparent need to prove that he (the narrator) has a love life by describing it in detail. Maybe he thought it helped to create the tough-guy detective persona. To me it just came across as adolescent.",negative
402,"I was appalled at the lack of class shown by all the members of this family. Money. - no matter how much - cant buy class. I was also very disturbed at the deceitful selling practices of their business, more so because they bragged about them. Trash people all the way. Also appalling that these people are given a forum to feed their egos. Skip it.",negative
403,"This music inspired by Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a real let down. I didn't enjoy one track and was surprised that it was even being marketed. With such a wonderful original motion picture soundtrack, there is no need for this recording in your music library.",negative
404,Deja Review is an innovative approach for Step 2 recall. I used this book as my primary resource and did outstanding on boards. Buy this book...you won't regret it!,positive
405,are you serious???? I am soo glad I didn't straight up try this on my lens... on the cap side it looks like a small cloth on a pen.. i put if on my hand to see how it felt and it left a black circle mark. I'm a newb and i'm sure it's not suppose to do that. really disappointed.,negative
406,I got to use this twice before the large screw on cap that is for draining the full container cracked and started dripping oil onto my garage floor. Not cool at all.EDIT: A cap from a Clorox bleach bottle will fit easily as a replacement cap for this if you want to try it.,negative

408,"After reading this book, I have a new appreciation of the blessing of a stable address, food in the refrigerator, and the ability to close a door and enter a space that allows privacy without fear of interruption. Ms. Ehrenreich has made it impossible to ever walk into a mega-mart store again and see the employees as faceless servants or to dismiss them as under achievers. Although her political sentiments sometimes lead to some naive and biased conclusions, this is a work that changed my perceptions and for that I thank her.",positive
409,"I found some of this book pretty good. I was put off, though, by the long drawn out sex scenes (to be fair, they weren't many,) the unnecessarily foul language, and the sense of ground already covered. And covered. And covered. I'd say the book would have been greatly benefitted, earning a 4, or perhaps even a 5, rating, had probably one quarter to one third of the book mercifully fallen to a more astute red pencil. Hint to author: ""Edit, edit, edit!""",negative
410,"Well if the code they sent me even worked, that would be cool. First time this has happened to me from amazon. Now I have to wait 7 days just for a replacement. Or whatever. Well I guess next time I'll go to eb or something.",negative

413,"This is the most demented book I have ever read. The author tries to suggest that Native Americans were just as ""human"" or destructive of the land as western people. Um....has he seen the land lately, it's a little changed since the English first arrived. It's mostly gone, covered with asphalt, and the animals? They are gone too. Of course they used the land they we human beings but to suggest that they were of the same mind as those that followed is a reach.",negative
414,"Marybeth Bond is one of my favorite travel writers. Whether she is compiling stories about women's travel: ""A Woman's Passion for Travel,"" ""A Woman's World"" or ""A Mother's World"" or providing us with sound travel advise through the Gutsy Women's series, Marybeth is a source of sound advice, untempered passion for adventure and an umitigated belief in the strength of women. Read her books and you will be inspired, touched and ready for adventure.",positive

417,"Board games are not supposed to be translated to video game platforms. Risk is a slow-moving, colorless, blank game that is only fun to some degree if playing with friends. Otherwise the computer opponent will relentlessly hunt you down and kill you, although the AI isn't too good. The controls aren't bad, but who cares! Buy the board game.",negative
418,"The Burns and Allen show should be viewed by all. It's a great family show to watch...no embarrassing moments -- no censoring whatsoever. Gracie and George were true comics, who delivered a wonderful show, week after week. I highly recommend this vido to be viewed by all.",positive

420,"My daughter wanted this just to listen to ""Once Upon Another Dream"". Wow! They sure know how to butcher classic Disney songs. And Disney tries to slide another one past us. ""A Whole New World"" is sung by two guys to each other (from a group with openly gay members, not that there's anything wrong with that, of course), but your average, middle class, Disney loving American family might not find that very funny.",negative
421,"This is a great time saver. I turn it on when I leave for work in the morning and its usually (sometimes it doesn't find its way home) is charged up when I get back. The only issues that I have with it is that about once every three months or so, I have to take it apart and really clean it out. I think the sensors are getting dirty. The other issue is that sometimes it will get stuck. Perhaps someone will come up with roomba friendly furniture.",positive
422,I concur with the other reviews of this product. It's a disgrace to the Wenger Brand. The battery life is nonexistent. Don't waste your money; buy a Coleman.,negative
423,"This is a biography that met all my requirements: it was fast paced, very informative, well written and well researched. There aren't many biographies that read like a novel, but this one does.

425,"I like to think I enjoy artsy films, but I found this work tedious despite its short length. It seemed like: (1) a bunch of friends were given hand-held cameras and allowed to shoot themselves (sometimes saying pretentious stuff) and whatever landscapes they thought looked cool, (2) the results were then cut into one and two minute segments and thrown in the air, and (3) an hour or so of the pieces were randomly gathered off the floor and taped into a video. Sure, you can make an artistic case for a dada-like experience, but for me, I was sorry I hadn't heeded poor reviews elsewhere.",negative

427,"While this ""Anthology"" of Rocky movie music is mostly satisfying, it falls short of capturing the real heart and soul of what makes Rocky movie music so compelling and distinctive. Presented here are the best vocal tracks from Rocky III and IV, which are worthy additions to any music collection. Also included are two Bill Conti imitation tracks of ""Gonna Fly Now"", both I might add, clearly inferior to the original.I bought this album thinking I could get the best of the Rocky music without having to buy all the originals. What I found is that the originals are what makes makes Rocky movie music so distinctive. Rather than purchase this album, I'd buy the original Rocky IV and the original Rocky soundtrack; there is more music, and it is all ""real"" Rocky music. Another option is to purchase the latest Rocky Anthology, ""Rocky Balboa"".Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",negative
